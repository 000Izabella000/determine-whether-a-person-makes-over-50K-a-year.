# determine-whether-a-person-makes-over-50K-a-year.
Hi everyone!
This is my first data science task. We will determine if person have over 50k a year.
There are not very complex code with detail explanations so I think even people without exepiriance will understand this.

To accomplish this task I use 2 methods: XGBClassifier and RandomForestClassifier.
Initially, I prepared a spreadsheet for processing. Ð¡hanged column types and filled in the missing fields.
After training and prediction I cupmute accuracy to both of this methods.

You'll find detail explanation in code.
Thank you for your time and attention!
